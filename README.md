# Welcome to qBay!

## Do you need a place to shop for items that QU students need? Well, you've come to the right place!

When you first run the program, please log in using your QU credentials, or the guest details if your login does not work. Note: if you fail to login 3 times, you will be locked out.

Once you are in the main menu, you can select either of the four options:

### Buy
Here, you are presented with the items that are currently for sale by other QU students! The name and price of the item are provided, but to view further details or add the item to your cart, enter the corresponding number. After you have selected an item, you can add it to your cart or return to the item list.

Of course, there is an option to go back to the main menu; it is the last one.

### Cart
In this section, you will see the items you have added to the cart earlier from the cart section. You can either checkout, or go back to the main menu.

### Sell
In the sell menu, you can view the items you have for sale, add a new item for sale, or go back to the main menu. If you decide to add a new item for sale, you will be prompted to specify the details of the item. 

### Logout
You will be logged out of the program and it will terminate.
